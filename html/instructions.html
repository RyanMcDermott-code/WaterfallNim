            <p>
                Players engage in a strategic battle, taking turns skillfully removing matches from rows.
                After each move, a decisive 'End Turn' button awaits, signaling the shift to the opponent. 
                The ultimate goal? Force your adversary into a position where they're compelled to snatch the 
                last remaining match on the screen. Should you crave a rematch or seek a clean slate, the power 
                to restart the game lies at your fingertips. It's not just a match, it's a thrilling showdown of wits and strategy!
